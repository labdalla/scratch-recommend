Apologies to those who think there&#39;s too much minecraft in the world.  It just happens to be a rather useful example to tiled gameplay taken to the max.  So there you go.

*** History ***

So what started out as a little break from Scratchnapped to test a new approach I&#39;d thought of to tiled scrolling has now swelled in to another hefty project, which I have to say I am enjoying immensely, a 2D Minecraft Clone! To achieve the scrolling, unlike in scratchnapped, I create a grid of sprites (whether the tile has something there or not), and as the sprites move off one side of the screen I swap their costumes and move them to the opposite side...  It&#39;s probably the fastest way of moving an entire screen of tiles that I have found thus far...

   Act as miner running an operation to collect Carbon (C), Iron (Fe), 
Silver (Ag), Gold (Au), and Plutonium (Pu)
   Carbon and Iron appear randomly on the board, simply pass over them to collect. Then, go to the chest in the top right corner and press SPACE to add it to your inventory.
   Then, you can drag the metals from your inventory into another metal to FUSE, or to the shop to SELL. Each metal can be fused from the two metals before it.
  
  In order to FUSE, you must drag one metal from your inventory and drop it on another. It does not matter which metal you drag. 
  FOR EXAMPLE: If you drag Carbon to Iron OR Iron to Carbon, it will both make silver. Below are the recipes for more metals:
 
 C + Fe = Ag
  Fe + Ag = Au
  Ag + Au = Pu

Prices for Selling -
 C - $1
 Fe - $3
 Ag - $6
 Au - $10
 Pu - 17

Note that it doesn't appear to be the touching test itself that is slow – the time for that remains practically zero. It's the refresh *after* the touching test that is slow. (BUT... see inside, and set either the ""do touch test"" custom block [in cat sprite], or the ""test"" custom block [in red circle sprite] to run without refresh... Huh?!)

Also, it's worse if the clones have different looks as I've done here (e.g. different sizes/directions/effects) – making them all look the same significantly reduces the slowdown.

The opposite test (getting the red circle to test if touching clones) also causes a slowdown if the clones have different looks.

Switching off Stage3D (ctrl-M/cmd-shift-M) avoids slowdown.

Really don't know why all of that would be the case...  :/",,Stage3D slow refresh after touch sprite test,https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/158676183,https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/158676183/embed,

-When asking for a part, link me a few examples of your animation.
-This map focuses on Brightheart remembering the time she and Swiftpaw fought the dogs together.

I thought it was a brilliant idea, since Asgore is literally collecting jars of hearts (SOULs). And then Toriel isn't just infuriated, but heartbroken, and wants to do everything she can to protect fallen children.
-----
So, the idea of this is that Toriel broke up with her husband Asgore a long time ago. (It's a long story.) Now, Asgore is trying to win her back, and she's telling him that it's never going to happen, because he broke her heart and killed the children she took care of.
The main character is Toriel, and Asgore is also rather important.
The background characters you can (and probably should) use are Frisk, Sans, the fallen humans/SOULs, Chara, and Asriel.
-----
RULES:
- PLEASE, PLEASE follow the real palettes/sprites for the characters! I included the sprites for Toriel and Asgore in the project so you'd have a reference, so if you want to include a background character, you can find their sprite and upload it.
- This is NOT a Soriel MAP. Please don't include anything Soriel related! (Not just because I don't like it, it's just not the focus here.)
- DO NOT steal art from other Scratchers. If I see you doing this, I will delete your part and exclude you from the MAP.
- This is a PMV MAP, since I thought it would be a little easier. You an include small animated loops, like walking or talking, but nothing big.
- Real codeword is your favorite Undertale ship! (My personal faves are Alphyne, NicePants, and Asgoriel!)
- There is no deadline, but I would appreciate if you had your part(s) done within a few months! (If you don't have it done by January 2019, tho, that's a different story XD)
- Limit of 3 parts!
- For this MAP, I would like for you to have some experience. I will check your projects if you ask for a part.
- I know I already said this, but I can't stress it enough. PLEASE use the sprites of the characters as references!
- Don't be rude/insult other people's parts. I've never had trouble with this, but still.
- Codeword is inside the project!

 - A mine
   If you reveal a mine, it explodes and it&#39;s game over for you.
 - A blank
   If you reveal a blank cell, you earn +5 points for each blank cell.
 - A number
   Number cells indicate the number of neighboring mines touching
   this cell, including diagonal neighbors.  For example, a 1 means
   this cell is touching exactly 1 mine.  A 3 means this cell is
   touching exactly 3 mines.  Etc.  Revealing number cells also
   earns +5 points.

The goal of the game is to discover where the mines are located and flag them.  If you think a cell is a mine, hold &lt;Space&gt; and click the cell to flag that cell as having a mine below it.  If you think a cell is not a mine, click it to reveal what&#39;s behind the tile.

 - A mine
   If you reveal a mine, it explodes and it&#39;s game over for you.
 - A blank
   If you reveal a blank cell, you earn +5 points for each blank cell.
 - A number
   Number cells indicate the number of neighboring mines touching
   this cell, including diagonal neighbors.  For example, a 1 means
   this cell is touching exactly 1 mine.  A 3 means this cell is
   touching exactly 3 mines.  Etc.  Revealing number cells also
   earns +5 points.

The goal of the game is to discover where the mines are located and flag them.  If you think a cell is a mine, hold &lt;Space&gt; and click the cell to flag that cell as having a mine below it.  If you think a cell is not a mine, click it to reveal what&#39;s behind the tile.

There are ten hidden mines and once you have correctly flagged all ten, you win the game.  Good luck!",DogSweeper,https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/12487113,https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/12487113/embed,

I like the song, but the level is annoying--- Like a demon.

Description of Clutterfunk:
   Clutterfunk introduces the size portals, which shrink and expand the player's size. It also introduces spinning sawblades of three sizes along with fake sawblades as a decoration of four sizes and two new block designs. It is the only level to end as a mini cube.

Secret Coins:
   The first secret coin is located at 30% and is collected as the ship. After switching from a mini cube into the ship, players must aim to carefully fly just above the 5th obstacle to reach the coin.
   The second secret coin is located at 65% and is also collected as the ship. After the ship switches gravity, the player must aim low and avoid the saw blade and carefully go through a 1-block wide opening to get the coin. A light tap is required to drop to the saw blade on the bottom.
    The third coin is located at 85% and is collected as the cube. The player must fall past the last yellow jump ring and jump along a tight path to grab the coin. Tapping a blue jump ring rebounds the player to the normal path.

==+==+==+[}==+==+==+[}==+==+==+[}==+==+==()[}

Stats:
Black holes are assumed to have a mass of 1, with the same being true of the Scratch Cat.

Ropes also have a mass of one, with a gravity of 1, and a friction of 0.7, when taunt. Ropes also can pass energy upwards, at a dampening rate of 0.3. The ropes also are a clone of the Scratch Cat; that cuts down on a gravity custom block!

When gravity&#39;s affect on an object is being computed, the distance is skewed by +2 so as to stop objects from getting velocities of 2,000+.

Rockets have no mass, though they are the rope clones, just showing vs. their previous hiding.

A fun fact about ropes is that they act like pendulums; who knew!

TnT works like a white hole; basically, it figures out its own gravity, reverse it, and calls that the explosion. Due to it being feeble, I made the &#39;gravity constant&#39; equal 20,000 for explosions. Also, the distance is skewed by 1, not the old 2.

Update log:

v.0.8.5 brings:
1). A small cut on CPU load with ropes.
2). A test with real-life pendulum physics, which ended up failing. The code is still there, if anyone wants to look, and if they can.
3). A bug fix with deleting black holes.

v.0.8.2 brings:
1). I solved a problem that&#39;s been giving me a headache for awhile...  also, more realistic rope physics. I will be testing out another model for ropes soon.

v.0.7.8 brings:
1). Simplified ropes. These scripts will be used in my upcoming Scratch game: Cut the Rope! It won&#39;t be my next project though; my Spanish homework/project will be. 

v.0.7.7 brings:
1). The cat now experiences friction.
2). TnT! Just press f.
3). The key d.

v.0.7.4 brings:
1). Improved rope physics; they don&#39;t act like a series of springs now, but rather a free falling object&amp;pendulum.
2). Rockets point left if their force is negative; thanks to a friend for suggesting that!
3). A few bug fixes!
4). Next will be d; the delete key!

v.0.6.6 brings:
1). Rockets to help me test the rope physics once improved...
2). A few slight changes.

v.0.6.5 brings:
1). A few touch ups.

v.0.6.4 brings:
1). Improved rope physics!
2). A few new keys; try em!
3). Ropes now reflect their velocity through their color&amp;shade.

v.0.5.6 brings:
1). Ropes!

v.0.4.0 brings:
1). Gravity, music, and the cat!

=♥= Notes =♥=
+ On  June 12, there was a shooting at a gay club in Orlando. 49 victims were killed, and the attacker was also shot. It was a very frightening thing, and I don't want to talk about that anymore. Instead, let's celebrate LGBT+ pride and awareness month!
+ LGBT+ stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and the + means there's much more!
+ Wow, this is actually getting a lot more popular than I expected p-p",,=♥= Pride Icon Requests =♥= [CLOSED],https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/111786053,https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/111786053/embed,

Needless to say, it is true, and here for you now. This is a robot master I designed myself, by drawing him out on paper, and creating 8-bit sprites for him on MS Paint. I made this intro to look like the boss intro from the original Mega Man.

-Solder Man Stats- (Pronounced as: SAH-DER)

Reason for Creation: Made to work in an industrial factory 
Weapon: Soldering Iron (S. Iron) A weapon that sticks out of the buster, and remains in front of the user until the button is released. When released, it will travel in a straight line at top speed. It will drain energy gradually while touching enemies, and subtract even more when fired. After being released, it will do more damage than usual
Weakness: Polar Freeze
Friends: None, due to his cold and dark personality
Rivals/Enemies: Main enemy is mankind, and all that associate with it in any way
Hobbies: None; all he does is sulk around his factory, hitting things with his Soldering Iron out of anger

More Background Info: Solder Man is one of the oldest existing robot masters in the known world. At his job, Solder Man was a hard-working yet kind machine. However, when a new industrial revolution took place, the factory where Solder Man worked was shut down. Before he could be taken away and scrapped, though, Solder Man's personality took a dark turn and became unapproachable and dangerous. For many decades, he roamed his factory as a lonely robot, and vowed never to work for another human again. When Wily invaded the abandoned factory, Solder Man tried to retaliate using self-defense, but was easily shut down, captured, and modified for combat.",Mega Man Boss Bash 2 - Solder Man Animations,https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/115376433,https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/115376433/embed,

Shameless Advert - Super scrolling tiled minecraft test project with animated Steve: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/12738968/

13-05-2013 - Update to WIP level designer sandbox - remix the following project and I can see your levels - perhaps we could even collab? http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/10126649

10-05-2013 - Woohoo, Scratch 2 is officially live! :) - I&#39;ve updated the scripts to try to get rid of the bug where moving platforms did not reappear on level 3... It&#39;s an annoying one because it&#39;s never happened to me, but I can understand how it might, so I&#39;ve tried a fix!

03-05-2013 - Have a play with my Work In Progress Level Editor here: http://beta.scratch.mit.edu/projects/10126649/ - This is actually the latest work in progress version of this project and will be merged back in with this one in time... I didn&#39;t want to do that yet though in case I&#39;d broken anything with the changes!

02-05-2013 - More changes to level spawning / scrolling code + New type of moving platform (controllable) + Changes to level 4... A little easier now? But hopefully still just as fun + Progress flags do not de-flag as other flags are reached.

01-05-2013 - Bit of another code rearrange with regard to level scrolling. I&#39;ve changed to have a larger despawn range compared to the standard just off screen spawning of tiles. This means there are more sprites to be handled at a time, but less to create and delete when hanging around the same location. Also, deletion is handled better... I&#39;m hoping this will rid us of the horrid disappearing bug.

30-04-2013 - Fixed group pounding on to moving platforms + death while completing level + Prevented moving platforms from despawning so they will always come back ;)

30-04-2013 - Level 4 added - Try it out now! This one will require a lot more skill to complete, and A LOT of skill to collect all the coins. It will definitely not stay as level 4 is it is too difficult for so early on in the game :)

29-04-2013 - Added way points and restored enemies and coins to point of last save. Added extra lives to be collected as alternative to coins when enemies are killed (depending on the number of lives you have left).

29-04-2013 - Reduced Scratches momentum a little, enable scratch to jump off of enemies when bouncing on their heads. Reduced number of coins on 2nd level to improve performace.

29-04-2013 - Stopped just off screen sprites from animating costumes needlessly.

28-04-2013 - Fixed group pound bugs in small areas.

27-04-2013 - Removed flashing &#39;next&#39; from title page. Prevent group pound in small contained areas causing glitch. Prevent ground pound on exit from level.

26-04-2013 - Performance Improvements - Clouds don&#39;t drift any more, but perhaps you never noticed anyhow? ;)
26-04-2013 - Introduced moment of friction that pulls scratch to a halt when his momentum is less than a critical amount and he&#39;s on the ground.
26-04-2013 - Increased Scratches ability to change his direction in the air. Let me know whether this improves things for you or hinders you - Thanks!
26-04-2013 - Fixed spelling errors on intro ;)

* Aim - Rescue all the Scratchlings (1 per level)... Thus far there&#39;s only 4 levels (This is a demo/preview - As I add new features these will be fleshed out and more added).

* Controls - Cursor keys to move (left &amp; right), up to jump. down while in the air to ground pound. Jump against a wall then jump again to wall jump/kick. If near the top ledge of a wall Scratch will cling on (from where you can either climb up, jump off or drop down).

Notes - See how many coins you can collect on your way, and whether you can get that possibly hidden or hard to get to Mega Coin on each level.  Some baddies can be stomped on, prickly ones and spiders can&#39;t (at present).  Don&#39;t fall off the bottom of the level... instant life lost.

There&#39;s so much more for me to add, and the levels will become a lot better as time goes by, but I am just dying for some feedback to all the work I have put in to this :) - I think you will like it!

Please note - This is not the finished game and some aspects are a little rushed compared to others...

Learned a bit about race conditions in testing for collisions.","Work in progress (instruction further down after this brief message)...
Things remaining to do are as follows:
1. Need to ensure the regeneration of ship does not land in middle of collision (gets annoying to loose a couple of ships that way in early levels). Similar logic to hyper drive (finding open field with largest available space)
2. Need to add bonus items (alien ships(done), shooting stars, etc) to get either extra points, limited shields, teleport (hyper drive), extra fuel.
3. Added risk items (a special alien death ship that is reflective to bounce laser back)… (done)
4. Need to add fuel limit per ship (adrift in space mode)
5. Need to adjust asteroid speed to be in proportion to size (smaller are faster)
6. Fracture angle should be somewhat randomized
7. Need asteroids to adjust trajectory when they collide (no fracture)
8. Twinkle background
9. Use sprites for points, level, and highscore (i.e., need number sprites 0…9)
10. List of initials for highest 10 scores.

Current Instructions:
Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to move the ship forward, backward, turn left, turn right.
Use the space bar to fire.

New ship for each level cleared, but limited to maximum number of ships depending on mode selected. Level = number of starting asteroids. In Terrestrial mode the motion is single-step (high friction) with 1/10/100 points for asteroid sizes, 4 ships to start with a 5 ship limit. In Space mode the motion is space-like and things can get insane quickly (in space no one can hear you scream); points are 10/100/1000 with 8 ships to start and a 10 ship limit.",asteroids,https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/12981798,https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/12981798/embed,

The hardest part of the project was determining how the sprite was to attack the monsters. Clearly the sprite itself could not touch the monsters, as that was supposed to cause a life to be lost, yet clearly the sprite had to somehow come in contact with the monster to &quot;kill&quot; it. After playing around for a while, I came across the idea to use a different sprite, one that was attached to the Link sprite at the hip, but was not part of the Link sprite, and could therefore touch the monster without losing a life. Therefore the attack sprite, or sprite 1 was born. It took quite a bit of fiddling, but eventually I was able to make the sprite do what I wanted after also slightly modifying the Link sprite. While this part of the project was a challenge, it was still quite an enjoyable experience. The second most time consuming part of the project was cropping all of the Link sprites for walking and attacking from 4 different directions. That took a substantial amount of time and energy, but I believe that the end product is worth the time invested. 

There should be sounds if you win or lose, as well as if you kill a monster or lose a life.

I'll do my best to go into as much detail as can be, although it is hard because I haven't slept in 42 hours, I crossed six time zones, and I've had the Tangled credit song (Something That I Want... I think?) stuck in my head since I aRriVEd iN haWaII.

Backstory(kinda xD)
Umbri and Esp where living happily in a family, still waiting for the eggs to hatch, then Suddenly Esp began to get a terrible disease, she stopped being herself and had more headaches, at first she thought she just had a cold, then everyday it got worse and worse, until the point where Umbri took her to the hospital and where the doctor said there was no cure so either she died from the disease or was killed then, he said she should have a few more days living. she was allowed home but wasn't allowed near the eggs. The next day she began to become pale and then she suddenly fell, meaning she died from the disease, Umbri fell into sadness and he held her paw and promised her that he would train the first hatched one (if it was a girl) to be a Espeon like her.(end of backstory)

 - A mine
   If you reveal a mine, it explodes and it&#39;s game over for you.
 - A blank
   If you reveal a blank cell, you earn +5 points for each blank cell.
 - A number
   Number cells indicate the number of neighboring mines touching
   this cell, including diagonal neighbors.  For example, a 1 means
   this cell is touching exactly 1 mine.  A 3 means this cell is
   touching exactly 3 mines.  Etc.  Revealing number cells also
   earns +5 points.

The goal of the game is to discover where the mines are located and flag them.  If you think a cell is a mine, hold &lt;Space&gt; and click the cell to flag that cell as having a mine below it.  If you think a cell is not a mine, click it to reveal what&#39;s behind the tile.

There are ten hidden mines and once you have correctly flagged all ten, you win the game.  Good luck!",Pokesweeper,https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/12513031,https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/12513031/embed,

 Lyrics here! :
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Part 1: August 15th at 12:30 noon I don't see a cloud above the sun is shining down. What a pretty day.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Part 2: So sick of this summer heat I can't beat away the haze the rays are giving way. And spending all my time having conversations sitting next to you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Part 3: ""Hey, but I, don't really like the summertime."" And as you were petting that cat you said such a daring thing right from under your breath.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Part 4: Ah, and as that cat had ran away, you tried to chase it in the end jumping out in front of a traffic light that poured a shade of red bright red.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Part 5: Crashing in and breaking you to bits that truck heard a scream a little bit too late. Blood dripping everywhere and choking your smell of hair I breathe in a gulp of air and just can't take it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Part 6: Are these lies? The heat is mocking me. ""What you say is exactly what your gonna get!"" And with the blue sky I hear singing crickets cry and fall right back into another dark sleep.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Part 8: Endlessly I see that over heated haze. And again the laughing will repeat on through the days.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Part 9: You've been dying for the past 10 years. We are trapped in cycles and the end is never clear.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Part 10: But a story is a story all the same and today like any has an ending so to say.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Part 11: Far away and beyond that scorching summer day...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Part 12: Crashing in hitting me instead of you I push you aside to nearly dodge a truck!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Part 13: Blood dripping everywhere and chocking my smell of hair. You breathe in a gulp of air and just can't take it. Are these lies? I haven't heard him say ""What you say is exactly what your gonna get!""
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Part 14: Maybe this summer day has finally gone away but that's all i'll say so this is where it ends now.

*spoilers*

RULES *please read!* ~

- Your part can be PMV or AMV style, it doesn't really matter.

- You need to have read the book that your part is from. For example, if you want to do Carnelian’s death, you need to have read at least up to Moon Rising. 

- Put the correct death scene in your part!

- Everyone is welcome! If you want to join, comment below and tell me what part you want. The codeword is at the bottom.

- Remix this project with your part.

- Don't use forever loops, and don't animate the backdrop.

- Don't use too much blood, and no gore. I know this is a deaths MAP, but try to keep it Scratch-appropriate.

- You don't have to send me links to any animations/artwork. I'll check your profile.

- Don't use too many sprites -- it makes it too laggy when all the parts are put together! Keep it one background and 1-2 sprites.

- ALL PARTS ARE DUE OCTOBER 15th. No exceptions. If you can't get your part done by then, tell me so I can give it to a backup. If you have your part almost but not quite done, share it and I'll finish it myself.

- You can have as many parts as you want. However, I'd prefer it if you only have one or two unfinished parts.

- Don't insult anyone else's parts.

- Please make sure your animation fits the length of the part. Don't just animate half of it and leave the rest of it frozen, or don't have your animation go over and be longer than the part.

- Backups are always appreciated! If you don't feel comfortable animating a whole part, ask to be a backup instead.

- Follow all the information on the inside of the project as well.


- Codeword: How many sprites you're allowed to have! >:3",Midnight Moon • Crocodile Death,https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/224362275,https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/224362275/embed,

Thanks for Top-Loved!

Instructions:
~ Use the arrow keys (or WASQ) to control your character through 15 levels
~ When you step off of your current block, it will fall
~ Make every block fall before completing the level
~ Block Guide (in order you find them in):
- Blue: Normal block, once you step off it will fall
- Green: Goal, after making every block fall, step onto this one
- Spike: Will go up and down, be careful and don't hit it!
- Grey: After stepping off once, it will turn into a blue block!
- Orange: As soon as you step on to it, it will start to break!
- Yellow: The spike will move up or down every time you move!
- Arrow: Moves you one step in that direction, doesn't affect yellow
~ Have fun!

_____________________________________________________________
Thank you so much for 50 followers! I'm so happy and thankful for each and everyone of them! Thank you @pandakun for being my 50th follower! So to thank you guys, I am hosting a PMV MAP! 
_____________________________________________________________
This is a semi-experienced PMV pallet MAP. PMV stand for Picture moive video. This means no animating, except for the instrumental parts. You can animate small things but It should not all be animated.
Show me one link of your art and I will respond in the next 48 hours. If you did not get the part, I'm sorry but I will be lenient with the art. Also, if you have done any PMV in the past, that will also give you a better chance of getting the part. If you want an animated part, send me a link to an animation you have made. Good luck!
_____________________________________________________________
Rules:
-PMV style only. You may animate little things if you want. (I will make
an exception for the instrumental part if you want.)
-Follow the pallet!
-Limit yourself to 1-2 sprites (Though I prefer to have 1 just to keep things simple.)
-Everyone gets a month. If you need an extension, I'll give you 2 weeks. After that, you don't get any more time (Sorry :3) 
-Include the lyrics in your part (unless you have an instrumental part)
-You can have a max of 2 parts (3 if I need more parts.)

For a smooth talker, put smoothness as 0.05. For a very slow talker, use 0.1
0.25 (shown in thumbnail) is VERY slow, but have a play around with different inputs to find your favourite speed.

Hello there!
Welcome to my Gradients Tips and Tricks tutorial thing! Wow, I haven't made a tutorial project in so long... Wait a minute, I don't think I've even made a tutorial project before xD

Anyway, welcome to my first tutorial/tips and tricks project! :3 I will be focusing on gradients, and I'll teach you tips and tricks about color schemes, transparent gradients, and more! Use the space bar and the arrow keys to flip through the slides, and use the ""m"" key to toggle the mouse trail on and off, and use the ""n"" key to mute and un-mute the music

Level of Difficulty: Beginner / All levels / 
Alevelsoeasyyoumightnotlearnanythingfromthisprojectlol

Please note these tricks may not work in Scratch Bitmap... However, they will work on Scratch 2 and Scratch 3 vector mode! :3

Don't know how to use gradients in Scratch 2? Here's a tutorial!
https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/100740745/

Another tip that I forgot to include is: don't use too vibrant colors in a gradient! :D Try to avoid using the bright color swatches in the Scratch editor.

- It will be faster. 
- It will feature Gobo, too.

Jasmine is a blue cat, and she doesn't know why. She falls in love with Ebony when he gives her a flower and disappears. She looks all over for him, but she is caught off guard and strong winds blow her into the ocean. She sinks to the city of Atlantis where she wakes up and discovers she's a mermaid. With all this seeming so unreal, Jasmine can't decide whether she's dreaming or it is all real. And if it is a dream, is Ebony a dream, too?

~Lyrics:
PART 1:
*Instrumental*

PART 2:
I used to rule the world,
seas would rise when I gave the word.
Now in the morning I sleep alone,
sweep the streets I used to own.

PART 3: [NOT INCLUDED]
*Instrumental*

PART 4:
I used to roll the dice,
feel the fear in my enemy's eyes.

PART 5:
Listen as the crowd would sing,
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the King!""

PART 6:
One minute I held the key,
next the walls were closed on me.
And I discovered that my castles stand,
upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand.

PART 7: [NOT INCLUDED]
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing,
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing.

PART 8: [NOT INCLUDED]
Be my mirror, my sword and shield,
my missionaries in a foreign field.

PART 9: [NOT INCLUDED]
For some reason I can't explain,
once you go there was never, never an honest word.
And that was when I ruled the world.

PART 10:
*Instrumental*

PART 11:
It was the wicked and wild wind,
blew down the doors to let me in.
Shattered windows and the sound of drums,
people couldn't believe what I'd become.

PART 12:
Revolutionaries wait,
for my head on a silver plate.

PART 13:
Just a puppet on a lonely string,
oh who would ever want to be king?

PART 14:
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing,
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing.

PART 15:
Be my mirror, my sword and shield,
my missionaries in a foreign field.

PART 16:
For some reason I can't explain,
I know Saint Peter won't call my name, never an honest word.
But that was when I ruled the world.

PART 17: [NOT INCLUDED]
*Instrumental*

PART 18:
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh

PART 19:
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing,
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing.

PART 20:
Be my mirror, my sword and shield,
my missionaries in a foreign field.

PART 21:
For some reason I can't explain,
I know Saint Peter won't call my name, never an honest word.
But that was when I ruled the world.

EDIT: I know the rules are complicated ���~��� Sorry not sorry ","RULES
   Act as miner running an operation to collect Carbon (C), Iron (Fe), 
Silver (Ag), Gold (Au), and Plutonium (Pu)
   Carbon and Iron appear randomly on the board, simply pass over them to collect. Then, go to the chest in the top right corner and press SPACE to add it to your inventory.
   Then, you can drag the metals from your inventory into another metal to FUSE, or to the shop to SELL. Each metal can be fused from the two metals before it.
  
  In order to FUSE, you must drag one metal from your inventory and drop it on another. It does not matter which metal you drag. 
  FOR EXAMPLE: If you drag Carbon to Iron OR Iron to Carbon, it will both make silver. Below are the recipes for more metals:
 
 C + Fe = Ag
  Fe + Ag = Au
  Ag + Au = Pu

Prices for Selling -
 C - $1
 Fe - $3
 Ag - $6
 Au - $10
 Pu - 17

Make sure to give credit if you use scripts. (as in, if you backpack the scripts, give credit, but if you learnt how to do the scripts, and built it in the editor, I don't need credit)

For the super clear blocks, use http://scratchblocks.github.io/generator/

Let's talk about smoothness:
For a smooth talker, put smoothness as 0.05. For a very slow talker, use 0.1
0.25 (shown in thumbnail) is VERY slow, but have a play around with different inputs to find your favourite speed.

 - A mine
   If you reveal a mine, it explodes and it&#39;s game over for you.
 - A blank
   If you reveal a blank cell, you earn +5 points for each blank cell.
 - A number
   Number cells indicate the number of neighboring mines touching
   this cell, including diagonal neighbors.  For example, a 1 means
   this cell is touching exactly 1 mine.  A 3 means this cell is
   touching exactly 3 mines.  Etc.  Revealing number cells also
   earns +5 points.

The goal of the game is to discover where the mines are located and flag them.  If you think a cell is a mine, hold &lt;Space&gt; and click the cell to flag that cell as having a mine below it.  If you think a cell is not a mine, click it to reveal what&#39;s behind the tile.
